## Hi there 👋

I'm a Data Science & Optimization Engineer working at the intersection of mathematical optimization, energy systems modelling, and scalable Python tooling. I hold a PhD in Mathematical Modelling & Optimization from University College London (UCL), where I focused on stochastic programming and uncertainty quantification for power system planning.
